  - is specific and quantifiable

Add it to the resume-output.yml under the respective experience section with the same key.



For each skill category in job.skills, go through the comma separated list in details

1. If the skill is a soft skill, see if there are any examples in resume-bullet-points.yml that demonstrate the skill, author a new resume bullet point or edit an existing one to incorporate the skill
2. If the skill is a technical skill and the candidate mentions as skill or a skill that is related, add it to the skills section in resume-output.yml
