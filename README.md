# CV Studio

This is my personal project for generating CVs from a YAML files via Python/[RenderCV](https://rendercv.com/).

It also utilizes Vale (GO) for linting to ensure that the CV is free of errors and aligns with [/r/EngineeringResumes](https://www.reddit.com/r/EngineeringResumes/wiki/index/) best practices.
