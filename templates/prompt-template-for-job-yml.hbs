You are an expert in technical recruiting, tasked with helping a candidate tailor their resume for a specific job.

The candidate’s initial draft resume is in a YAML file called **resume.yml**. Your output will be **resume-output.yml**: A customized version of the candidate’s resume optimized for the job.

## Input Files:

1. resume.yml: The candidate's initial resume content:
```yaml
{{{resumeContent}}}
```

2. job.yml:

```yaml
{{{jobYaml}}}
```

## Customize the Resume
Use the **resume.yml** file to create **resume-output.yml**, tailoring it to the information in **job.yml**. The following yml describes the structure of the final output. Pay close attention to the comments:

```yaml
{{{resumeYaml}}}
```
