  - Echoes the phrasing and structure of the corresponding checklist item in job.yml, adapting to fit the candidate's experience
  - Include specific, quantifiable achievements or methods from the resume-bullet-points.yml to demonstrate alignment with the checklist items
  - Is specific and detailed, avoiding vague or general statements
  - Incorporates relevant keywords from job.yml wherever appropriate

  - does not contain the words "I" or "my"
