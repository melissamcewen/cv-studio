    # If the position I'm applying for is different from the position I currently hold, create a summary that emphasizes my previous relevant positions. For example, if my last position was manager and I am applying for a senior software engineer role:
    # "I am looking to transition back to being an individual contributor senior software engineer, following several years of leading teams and heading up engineering at a startup. Though I enjoyed leading and growing teams I missed being hands-on the day-to-day. On top of my freshly sharpened coding skills, I bring strong mentorship skills, and a track record of delivering strong business results to the table."
