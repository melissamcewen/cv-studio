    summary:
    # If the target role differs from my most recent experience, craft a narrative explaining my interest in that role while showcasing recent skills and accomplishments.
    # For example, if the most position was "manager" and I am applying for a "senior software engineer" role, the summary should explain why I want to transition back into hands-on technical work, mention how many years (if any) experience I have in the target role, and highlight any relevant skills or accomplishments.
    # the summary should be 3-5 sentences long

    #    start_date: 2010-08
    #    end_date: 2011-08
    #    key: columbia
    #    highlights:
    #      - "something irrelevant to the job being applied for"
    # Then the output for that job should exclude highlights and be the job company, position, location, start_date, end_date
    #  - company: JobCorp
    #    position: Junior Application Developer

        # Resume bullet points. Tailor them to the job being applied for.
        # If there is nothing relevant to the job being applied for, you can omit highlights for that job
        # Bullets should start with an action verb, say what was accomplished, how the accomplishment was measured (numbers if included), and how it was acheived. Add as many as needed.
        # be specific and use numbers when possible, but don't make up numbers if they don't exist in the input resume.yml
