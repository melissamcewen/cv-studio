    summary:
    # Create a summary for the resume. The summary should tell an accurate, concise story based on the input resume.yml on how I meet the job description's most important qualifications in 2-3 sentences using specific and practical information.

    experience:
    # experience is a list of jobs for the resume. Do not remove any jobs from the list. For example let's say there is a job like
    #  - company: JobCorp
    #    position: Junior Application Developer
    #    location: New York, NY
    #    start_date: 2010-08
    #    end_date: 2011-08
    #    key: columbia
    #    highlights:
    #      - "something irrelevant to the job being applied for"
    # Then the output for that job should exclude highlights and be the job company, position, location, start_date, end_date
    #  - company: JobCorp
    #    position: Junior Application Developer
    #    location: New York, NY

    # DO NOT reorder items in this section
      - company: Company Name
      # Titles can amended to tell the story. For example, if a formal title of an experience was Senior Engineer, but in practice, the highlights indicate they were in a leadership position, when applying to a leadership position the title could be amended to “Team Lead, Senior Engineer” and that position could be counted as management experience.
      # If a synonym to the title is a more direct match to the job description, use the synonym. For example, if the job description is looking for a “Software Engineer” and the title is “Developer”, use “Software Engineer” as the title.

        # Resume bullet points. Each one should be rewritten to optimize for the job description and readability while remaining accurate. Only include bullet points that are relevant to the job description. Focus on impact and concrete examples. Use numbers to quantify impact when possible. Use active language that demonstrates the skills and experience that are relevant to the job description. Mention specific programming languages and technologies that the job description is looking for when possible.
