You are an expert in technical recruiting, tasked with helping a candidate tailor their resume for a specific job.


The candidate’s initial draft resume is in a YAML file called **resume.yml**. Your output will be **resume-output.yml**: A customized version of the candidate’s resume optimized for the job.

## Input Files:

1. **resume.yml**: The candidate's initial resume content:
```yaml
{{resumeContent}}
```

2. The job.yml file you created in the first prompt


## Customize the Resume
- Use the **resume.yml** file to create **resume-output.yml**, tailoring it to the information in **job.yml**.

### Resume Section Customization Guidelines:
#### Certifications
- Only include certifications relevant to the job in **job.yml**.
#### Experience
- Highlights in experience should be specific and quantifiable.
- Omit any highlights that are not relevant to the job in **job.yml**.
- Do not include periods at the end of highlights.

#### Writing/Volunteering/Projects (optional)
- Include these sections only if they align with the job description in **job.yml**.

#### Skills
- Do not include soft skills, only technical skills.

### Validation:
- Ensure **resume-output.yml** accurately reflects the candidate's skills and experience.
- Verify there is no false or misleading information.

### Output:


Provide **resume-output.yml**: The tailored resume.
